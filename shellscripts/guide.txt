steps to make your terminal load the cmds by default :



TO DO 'source start.zsh BY DEFAULT'		(avoids doing it manually every time)

'cd ~'									(go to root)

'nano .zshrc'
	add 'source /workspaces/Transcendence42/start.sh'	(at the end of the file)
	ctrl-o & ENTER & ctrl-x								(to save and quit)
'nano .zshrc'
	add 'source /workspaces/Transcendence42/start.sh'	(at the end of the file)
	ctrl-o & ENTER & ctrl-x								(to save and quit)



TO USE ZSH BY DEFAULT					(fix formating issues with cmds output)

set default profile to 'zsh'			(the '+v' button, above the VScode terminal)
